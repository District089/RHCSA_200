Mount and Unmount Network File Systems Using NFS
Check the status of the nfs-server:
sudo systemctl status nfs-server.service
Make a new directory named "/export/docs":
sudo mkdir -p /exports/docs
Update the ownership of the directory:
sudo chown -R root:wheel /exports/docs
Update the directory permissions:
sudo chmod 700 /exports/docs
Configure the share:
sudo vim /etc/exports
In the file, paste the following:
/exports/docs     <PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS_FOR_SERVER_2>(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
Note: The IP address for the second server can be found in the Credentials section of the lab.

Save the file:

Enable and start the NFS server:
sudo systemctl enable nfs-server.service
sudo systemctl start nfs-server.service ; systemctl status nfs-server.service
List the details for the NFS server :
showmount -e
In /exports/docs/, make a new directory named "server1-dir":
sudo mkdir -p /exports/docs/server1-dir
Add a file to the new directory using touch:
sudo touch /exports/docs/server1-file
List the contents of the /exports/docs directory:
sudo ls -l /exports/docs/
SSH to the second server:
ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS_FOR_SERVER_2>
From server 2, list the NFS server details on server 1:
showmount -e <PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS_FOR_SERVER_1>
In server 2, create a new directory in /mnt named "nfsdocs":
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfsdocs
Mount the /exports/docs directory from server 1, to /mnt/nfsdocs:
sudo mount <PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS_FOR_SERVER_1>:/exports/docs /mnt/nfsdocs
Update the ownership of the directory:
sudo chown -R root:wheel /mnt/nfsdocs
Update the directory permissions:
sudo chmod 770 /mnt/nfsdocs
List the contents of the nfsdocs directory:
ls -l /mnt/nfsdocs/
Open the /etc/fstab file:
sudo vim /etc/fstab
Use "G" to move to the end of the file, and use "o" to open an additional line, and add the following:
<PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS_FOR_SERVER_1>:/exports/docs        /mnt/nfsdocs        nfs    defaults    0 0
Save and exit the file:
ESC
ZZ
Unmount the /mnt/nfsdocs directory:
sudo umount /mnt/nfsdocs
Mount the /mnt/nfsdocs directory:
sudo mount /mnt/nfsdocs
List the contents of the nfsdocs directory:
ls -l /mnt/nfsdocs/
Make a new directory named "server2-dir1" in the /nfsdocs/ directory"
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfsdocs/server2-dir1
Add a file to the new directory using touch:
sudo touch /mnt/nfsdocs/server2-file1
Exit server 2:
exit
List the contents of /exports/docs
ls -l /exports/docs
